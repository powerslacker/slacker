      <title>Interfaces Are Useless</title>

      <description>When I first started using Go, one of the most confusing aspects was the interface type. I tried reading the source code of common interface definitions. I tried reading several tutorials. For a long time, I thought that interfaces were pointless, useless, and confusing.
The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that the interface type &amp;ndash; although useless &amp;ndash; is far from pointless and only slightly confusing. The interface through it&amp;rsquo;s uselessness, can be a powerful tool in the Go programmer&amp;rsquo;s arsenal.</description>

      <title>Golang: A Synopsis</title>

      <description>This article is an attempt to coalesce the answers to many frequently asked questions on Golang I have seen floating around the net. I sense that many of the Go FAQ&amp;rsquo;s leave something to be desired in terms of the history of Go and it&amp;rsquo;s nature. I wanted to try my hand at a more robust introduction to Golang, that would give some context to the intention, history, and feel of the language and the community that has formed around it.</description>

12/11/17, 11:51 PM - So, uh&amp;hellip;this post is blowing up on Hacker News. I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in months and just got several months worth of traffic in a few hours. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if my ramblings are really more important than the MDN docs but special thanks to neoasterisk - whoever you are!
This post is top 3 on hacker news. Not bad for a random rant I threw together!</description>
