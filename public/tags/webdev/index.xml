      <description>A few weeks ago, one of my posts &amp;ldquo;RE: PHP to Golang and Back Again&amp;rdquo; made it to the front page of Hacker News. It stayed at the third position on the front page for several hours, and was on the front page itself for no less than twelve hours! This was a major traffic boost for my blog, resulting in nearly thirty-thousand unique visitors in under two days. At one point, Google Analytics reported over one-thousand concurrent users.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t know if my ramblings are really more important than the MDN docs but special thanks to neoasterisk - whoever you are!
This post is top 3 on hacker news. Not bad for a random rant I threw together!</description>
