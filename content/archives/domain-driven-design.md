### Entities

An entity is an object that is defined by its identity rather than its attributes. For example, let's say I buy a car, take it home, and replace the stock wheels with aftermarket wheels. Though the car has been modified, its identity has not, it is still fundamentally the same car.      It is important to note that just because something has a unique identifier does not make it an entity. It is the principle that a change to the object's attributes does not change its identity.
