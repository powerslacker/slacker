Nav, my current workplace practices one of the most useful meeting formats I've ever seen: the one-to-one. 

## What is a one-to-one meeting?

A one-to-one meeting is exactly what it is says on the tin. A meeting between one person and another. In practice, this is a manager and one of their reports. What separates these meetings from any other is a regular cadence, open format, and opportunity for employees to share information between different levels of  management within a company.
