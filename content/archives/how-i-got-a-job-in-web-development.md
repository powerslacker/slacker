Several friends recently asked me for advice on how to get a job as a programmer. The written word scales infinitely better than one-to-one conversations so I decided to write up this article in case anyone else asks me for my story.  

The Early Years

Sometime in the early 2000's I was homeschooled with resources provided by a local charter school. They offered a number of extracurriculars, some of which were computer related. The workbooks for computer courses came with a 'free' desktop computer if selected. I didn't know much about computers at the time, but I did know one thing: you can play video games on them. So I asked my parents to sign me up for a basic HTML development course and a computer was delivered to my house a few weeks later.

Grateful for my good fortune, I decided to complete the HTML workbook as quickly as possible so I could prove to my parents that letting me play on the computer most of the day was a good use of my time. One of the first lessons in the book was changing the color of a font. When I saw that font change color, I felt a sense of real accomplishment and wonder. I had found a medium where I could express almost anything freely! I completed what was supposed to be six months of assigned work in a matter of days. Going back to crunching math problems and studying vocabulary lists was a bore in comparison.

As a homeschooled kid with ample free time and a working internet connection, my original dream of playing video games on the computer quickly became a reality. I didn't have many friends, but those I had were all playing the online game Neopets. One of the most interesting parts of Neopets was that you could set up a shop and sell in-game goods to other players for in-game currency. Upon visiting the shops of other players, I came to realize that you could customize your shop using HTML. The makers of Neopets even provided a guide for beginners to learn the more advanced functionality of HTML. I spent hours upon hours studying and making my shop more aesthetically pleasing.

As a middle schooler, my shop was one of my proudest accomplishments. My parents found out what I had been working on and would talk to their friends about it. I got a reputation as the kid who was good with computers. Before long, my parent's friends were calling my house anytime they needed their printer fixed, caught a computer virus, or couldn't figure out how to set up their new router. During the next few years I learned more about computers and networking than I ever intended to. It wasn't that I was great with computers, but rather that I was patient, interested, and willing to work for peanuts.

Working as a Freelancer

Through my little business, I ended up knowing a local photographer whose computer I had worked on. During the summer before high school he offered me $10/hour to work as his assistant editing photos using Adobe Photoshop. I didn't know how to use Photoshop, but he offered to train me. He told me I would get about 30 hours a week of work. I did some quick math in my head, figured that was more money than I had ever had in my life and agreed on the spot. I'm not sure if it was legal for a kid my age to work like that but it kept me in spending cash for my entire first year of high school.

At the end of the summer, the  photographer asked me to build him a website to enhance the image of his business. I still didn't know how to build a proper website, but he offered me $500 to get it done. Through a lot of google searching, forum discussions, and reading tutorials, I was able to cobble together a shoddy website using the HTML skills I had picked up. I learned about FTP, how to register a domain name, and what a CNAME was used for. Most importantly, I learned that I had acquired a marketable skill. 

During my high school years, I picked up jobs working on websites for various small business owners for extra cash. For a high school kid the pay was good, and it beat flipping burgers. I didn't intend to be ever be a professional programmer, since I didn't think there was that much money in the industry unless you got very lucky. Bill Gates was the only majorly wealthy programmer that I knew of.

By the time I was graduating high school, I planned to become a stock broker since I didn't want to go to college and I was fairly confident I could pass the Series 7 with a few months of study. Then the economy nosedived: the subprime mortgage crisis was in full swing. 

I could barely get a job. I had a little savings but not enough to go to college or move out of my parents place. Worse still, the college graduates I did know could barely get a job. I tried to pick up more freelancing work, but unlike my early years, there was stiff competition. A lot of professional programmers had been laid off and I was simply outclassed in terms of skill. I worked dead-end jobs in retail and food service just to have some money, but it only took a few months before I came to the conclusion that I was absolutely terrible at it and had no chance of making a proper life from a minimum wage job. 

I kept trying to get freelance web development gigs, and I got a few here and there. My new clients wanted their sites to have more advanced functionality than I was used to. The web was taking off and many small businesses wanted to copy functionality they saw on the big well-funded sites. I had no idea what I was doing, but if I wanted to get paid I had no choice but to learn. I knew I needed help. I asked around on the internet how to get some mentoring and they told me to start attending local programming meetups so I could meet professionals. I attended my first meetup and found that many of the professionals were eager to share bits of their knowledge with me.  

They directed me to online resources where I could really get a grip on building web applications. It turned out that many colleges were publishing their lectures online. I searched around and found a [free course]() by an adjunct professor at the University of Texas that was truly aimed at beginners. I followed along with the course diligently and I learned about databases, authentication, deploying software to the web, and REST. That course unlocked the tools I had needed to compete with professionals and I was able to pick up more freelance work. 

After a few years of working odd jobs and working freelance gigs, I came to the conclusion that I might as well become a professional programmer since it was the only type of employment I had any passion for. I ended up finally going to college. After two years
