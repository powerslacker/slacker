## Omissions

### 1 John 5:7-8

#### KJV

> **1 John 5:7** - For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
>
> **1 John 5:8** - And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

#### CSB

> **1 John 5:7** - For there are three that testify:
>
> **1 John 5:8** - the Spirit, the water, and the blood ​— ​and these three are in agreement.

_The CSB references the KJV reading of 1 John 5:7 in a footnote._

This is not an "easier reading" in my eyes; it's an omission. These are not equivalent passages when read side-by-side, as the CSB reading does not contain the same content as the KJV. The CSB removes the qualifying statements of "in heaven" and "in earth".  Additionally, the CSB removes a reference to The Trinity. The first verse in the KJV is both a record of The Trinity (aka Triune God/Godhead) in the early church, as well as a reference to heaven.  The latter verse in the KJV makes a clear distinction between the temporal (earthly) witnesses in contrast to heavenly witnesses. The separation between heaven and earth is a doctrinal concern. The Trinity is a doctrinal concern.  The CSB has effectively omitted 1 John 5:7 and partially omitted 1 John 5:8 thus affecting doctrine.

### Mark 16

This chapter is omitted in it's entirety. This is common in modern bibles as the method of translation and manuscripts used greatly differ.

### Mark 13:14

#### KJV

> But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:

#### CSB

> When you see **the abomination of desolation** standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.

The CSB removes an explicit affirmation of Daniel's  status as a prophet. 

## Modifications

### Matthew 27:34-35

#### KJV

> **Mat 27:34** - They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted _thereof_, he would not drink.
>
> **Mat 27:35** - And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.

#### CSB

> **Mat 27:34** - they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
>
> **Mat 27:35** - After crucifying him, they divided his clothes by casting lots.
