## Omissions

### 1 John 5:7-8

#### KJV

> **1 John 5:7** - For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
>
> **1 John 5:8** - And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

#### CSB

> **1 John 5:7** - For there are three that testify:
>
> **1 John 5:8** - the Spirit, the water, and the blood ​— ​and these three are in agreement.

_The CSB references the KJV reading of 1 John 5:7 in a footnote._ 

This is not an "easier reading" in my eyes; it's an omission. These are not equivalent passages when read side-by-side, as the CSB reading does not contain the same content as the KJV. The CSB removes the qualifying statements of "in heaven" and "in earth".  This is important because the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost are all "in heaven". Additionally, the CSB removes a reference to The Trinity. The first verse in the KJV is both a record of The Trinity (aka Triune God/Godhead) in the early church, as well as a fundamental element of Christian Theology.  The CSB has effectively omitted 1 John 5:7.
