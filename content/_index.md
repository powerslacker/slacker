title: "Read My Stuff"
---

### hello there,

I'm a backend engineer for the web. That means I make stuff for the internet, and on occasion people pay me to do so. I started this site because I can't seem to keep my reddit comments under a thousand words.

#### Why should I care? 

You shouldn't. You have better things to do with your life. When was the last time you exercised?

#### What Do You Post About?

Whatever I feel like. Mostly programming.

#### Can I go now?

That was always allowed.
